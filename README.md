# Reminder App Challenge

Objective: Build a reminder app using Flutter with the BLoC pattern.
Requirements:
- Time reminders: Users can set multiple reminders throughout the day (e.g., 9:00
AM, 10:00 AM, 12:00 PM).
- Storage: Utilize a local database solution like Hive, Sqflite, or similar to store
reminders persistently on the device. (Alternatively, consider using Firebase Firestore
or Realtime Database for a cloud-based approach.)
- Notifications: Trigger local notifications on the device at the designated reminder
times.
- Focus on UI/UX: Create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface for adding,
managing, and viewing reminders.
- Bonus: Implement location-based reminders (e.g., remind the user at a specific
location).
